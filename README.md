#Camp Wisconsin UI

Camp Wisconsin UI is the front-end for the camp-wisconsin website. This project is built with React and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). The Camp Wisconsin UI website connects to the [Camp Wisconsin API](https://github.com/jeremy-breidenbach/camp-wisconsin-api) to retrieve campground and campsite details.
